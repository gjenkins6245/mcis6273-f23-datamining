    "#### *How data scientists use Python* Task Responses  \r\n",
    "1.  - I learned about the differences between software development and data science.\r\n",
    "    - I learned about the many different environments and platforms where you can write Python.\r\n",
    "    - I learned about the incompatibility of moving from Python 2 to Python 3.\r\n",
    "2. The podcast was a great introduction to Python and Data Science. The topic of documenting code is something I very much agree with. There have been times when I didn't document/comment my code and it took me much longer than it should have to refresh myself on the code months later. This is amplified by interacting with code written by others.\r\n",
    "3. Yes, it introduced me to some of the many Data Science Python libraries and typical approach to Data Science.\r\n",
    "4. The most *surprising* fact for me was how different the approaches to software development and Data Science are. My background is more in Software development, and I am more familiar with class-based programming. I was not aware that Data Science does not typically follow that same appoach.\r\n"
